Easy to use single-image style transfer

This is still very much a work in progress! Currently, you should be able to run style transfer using the Gatys et al. method
[(paper linked here)](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf).

Please be aware that runtime may be slow when using a CPU (2-3 minutes or so). On GPU, this would reduce to about 10-30 seconds.
